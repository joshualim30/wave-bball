## Description

Wave Basketball is a web application made originally for the boys 17u AAU team in 2024. Created by Joshua Lim, a then 21-year old student attending the University of Central Florida, the web app was designed to promote his team and gather interest from potential players and more. It is also used as a point of contact, and even a side project for Joshua to showcase his skills in web development.
